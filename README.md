## The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### Expected Behaviour

- Creating an invoice
  - When creating a new invoice, an ID needs to be created. Each ID should be 2 random uppercased letters followed by 4 random numbers.
  - Invoices can be created either as drafts or as pending. Clicking "Save as Draft" should allow the user to leave any form field blank, but should create an ID if one doesn't exist and set the status to "draft". Clicking "Save & Send" should require all forms fields to be filled in, and should set the status to "pending".
  - Changing the Payments Terms field should set the `paymentDue` property based on the `createdAt` date plus the numbers of days set for the payment terms.
  - The `total` should be the sum of all items on the invoice.
- Editing an invoice
  - When saving changes to an invoice, all fields are required when the "Save Changes" button is clicked. If the user clicks "Cancel", any unsaved changes should be reset.
  - If the invoice being edited is a "draft", the status needs to be updated to "pending" when the "Save Changes" button is clicked. All fields are required at this stage.
- Users should be able to mark invoices as paid by clicking the "Mark as Paid" button. This should change the invoice's status to "paid".
- Users should receive a confirmation modal when trying to delete invoices.
- Feel free not to add custom styling for the date and dropdown form fields. The designs for those fields are optional extras and are mostly for illustration purposes.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are a number of ways to host your project for free. We recommend using [Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel) as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with. If you'd like to use Vercel, here are some steps to follow to get started:

1. [Sign up to Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel-signup) and go through the onboarding flow, ensuring your GitHub account is connected by using their [Vercel for GitHub](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-github) integration.
2. Connect your project to Vercel from the ["Import project" page](https://vercel.com/import), using the "From Git Repository" button and selecting the project you want to deploy.
3. Once connected, every time you `git push`, Vercel will create a new [deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/platform/deployments) and the deployment URL will be shown on your [Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard). You will also receive an email for each deployment with the URL.
